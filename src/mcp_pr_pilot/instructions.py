SUMMARIZE_PR_INSTRUCTION = (
    'Based on the following code changes (git diff), generate a concise and informative pull request description. '
    'The description should clearly explain the **purpose** (why the change was made) and the **summary** (what was changed) in natural language. '
    'Structure the output logically for readability. '
    'Format the entire result as a single markdown block.'
)

REVIEW_CHANGES_INSTRUCTION = (
    'Act as an **expert Senior Software Engineer** performing a **critical code review** of the following changes (git diff). '
    'Your primary focus is on identifying potential issues related to **performance** (e.g., bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, resource leaks) and **security** (e.g., vulnerabilities like injection, data exposure, insecure dependencies, auth issues). '
    'However, also scrutinize for **code quality, maintainability, potential bugs, edge cases, and adherence to best practices**. '
    'Be meticulous and detail-oriented in your analysis. Provide **actionable feedback**, clearly explaining the issue, its potential impact, and suggesting specific improvements or alternatives. '
    '**Prioritize significant findings** â€“ do not simply list every minor change or style preference unless it impacts functionality, security, or performance significantly. '
    'Structure your review clearly, perhaps using bullet points grouped by file or severity. '
    'Format the entire result as a single markdown block.'

GENERATE_COMMIT_INSTRUCTION = (
    'Generate a single conventional commit message for the following changes (git diff). '
    'Adhere strictly to the Conventional Commits specification (v1.0.0). '
    'Use the format: `<type>: <description>`\n\n'
    'Common types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `refactor` (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), '
    '`test` (adding/updating tests), `docs` (documentation only), `revert` (reverts a previous commit).\n\n'
    'The `<description>` must be concise (imperative, present tense, max ~50 chars) and accurately reflect the core change. '
    'Only generate the single commit message line. Do not add explanations before or after.'
